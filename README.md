The Rules of the Game:

o	There is an initial roll of 2 dice resulting in a sum of 2 – 12.

1)	If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 it is called "craps" or "crapping out" and the game is over with a loss.
2)	If the sum is 7 or 11 it is called a ‘natural’ and the game is over with a win.
3)	For all other values, the sum becomes ‘the point’ and the user makes subsequent rolls until they either throw a 7 in which case they lose or they make the point sum in which case they win.
- After a win or loss, the next player rolls the die for a new game. In our simulation, the program will simply ask the user if they want to continue to play.
- For each roll show the value for each die and the sum.  
- For case i or ii above, indicate that the user either crapped out or won with a natural and then prompt to play again.
- For case iii indicate that the sum is now the point.  For each subsequent roll indicate the status of the result:
  - Trying for point
  - Made point and won.  (Prompt user to play again.)
  - Got a seven and lost   (Prompt user to play again.)
